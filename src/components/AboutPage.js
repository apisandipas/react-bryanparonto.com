                            <p>I am driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, a need to constantly challenge myself, and a desire to produce work that is cleanly coded and focused on usability.</p>
                            <p>I've spent the last 3 years at <a target="_blank" href="http://doejo.com/">Doejo</a>, an award-winning Chicago-based digital agency as a web developer working with a variety
                             of brands bigs and small. I played an active part in interviewing new-hires, mentoring junior developers and organized the annual hackathon event.</p>
                            <p>I'm currently living in Portland, Oregon starting my hunt for my next new professional opportunities.</p>
                            <p>I'm looking to take on new challenges in a Javascript-centric role on a product team or small agency.</p>
